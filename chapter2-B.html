            <p> LR trusts the wolf and tells him where she is going. The wolf takes a shortcut to the grandmother's house and eats the grandmother.

            <p> LR finally reaches the grandmother's house after taking a roundabout path. Her grandmother seems to be bigger and hairy than before. </p>
